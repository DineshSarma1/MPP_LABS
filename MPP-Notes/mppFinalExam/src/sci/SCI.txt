Purification leads to progress:  
If something needs to be improved, there are positive changes on a regular basis. The same thing happens with the Java programming language. 
 Prior to the introduction of Java 8,  functional programming was not available. 
 This was one of the drawbacks of Java, but due to the improvements in the  Java language's drawbacks, 
 Functional programming has been introduced to help improve Java functionality. Now the functional programming
 enables to declare the task rather than implementing it. Similar things happens on consiousness space. The more
 declarative the more abstract. The TM helps to get in to the deeper silence by purifying all the surface level noise.
